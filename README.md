# flow-oriented-programming

1. A flow of execution consists of data and functions.  
2. Data is a unit of information.  
3. A state can have n data.  
4. A function is a unit of state change.  
5. A function can have n input addresses and n output addresses.  
6. Functions and data can have concrete addresses.  
7. Functions and data can have abstract addresses.  
8. A function can receive abstract addresses of data and functions as input.  
9. A function can return concrete addresses of data and functions as output.  
10. Functions can contain other sequential functions.  
11. Functions can contain other parallel functions.  
12. Functions can contain selection structures.  
13. Functions can have loop structures.  
14. Addresses that know each other are part of the same layer.  
15. Addresses that do not know each other are in different layers.  
16. Every input forms a layer.  
17. A layer is a replaceable unit.  
18. Different layers form a context.  
19. The flow execution occurs when the context is complete.
